</h2>
<p>Most of the settings of interest to an administrator are on Adapt
It's Administrator menu. This menu is normally hidden from view. It
can only be shown and accessed under password control. To make the
Administrator menu visible you can select the <strong>Show
Administrator Menu</strong> menu item from the View menu. To
initially show the Administrator menu you will need to use the
<a href="#default_password">default password</a>. Once you have
access to the Administrator menu you can assign a personalized
password for accessing the Administrator menu, however, the <a href="#default_password">default
password</a> will always work to make the Administrator menu visible
at any time.</p>
<p>The Adapt It team highly recommends that you take advantage of the
Administrator menu's configuration options, since a careful setup can
make it easier for a user to do productive work within Adapt It, and
much easier to collaborate with a dedicated Scripture editor such as
<a href="#Paratext_Steps_Start">Paratext</a> or <a href="#Bibledit_Steps_Start">Bibledit</a>

Adapt It Projects versus Paratext or Bibledit Projects</h2>
<p><font color="#000000">Some of the discussion about establishing
connections between Adapt It and Paratext or Bibledit projects may be
confusing if you are not aware of the different approaches these
translation applications have to translation projects. Both Paratext
and Bibledit consider a project to involve the creation of a
translation in only </font><strong><font color="#000000">one</font></strong><font color="#000000">
language. These applications may bring in translation resources such
as Bible translations in other languages to assist the human
translator. Each translation resource is stored in a single
Paratext or Bibledit project.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Since Adapt It partially automates the
translation process it involves the use of <i><b>two</b></i>
languages in its projects:</font></p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p>A <strong>source</strong> language text which has been
	prepared before the start of the project.</p>
	<li/>
<p>A <strong>target</strong> language text which is developed
	as the output of the adaptation process.</p>
</ul>
<p><font color="#000000">Because Adapt It works with a minimum of two
languages, collaboration requires the development of at least </font><strong><font color="#000000">two</font></strong><font color="#000000">
projects in Paratext or Bibledit for each Adapt It project:</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.54in; text-indent: -0.25in"><font color="#000000">1.</font><span style="font-variant: normal"><font color="#000000">     
</font></span><font color="#000000">A </font><strong><font color="#000000">source</font></strong><font color="#000000">
project in Paratext or Bibledit that already has text that can serve
as the Adapt It source document.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.54in; text-indent: -0.25in"><font color="#000000">2.</font><span style="font-variant: normal"><font color="#000000">     
</font></span><font color="#000000">A </font><strong><font color="#000000">target</font></strong><font color="#000000">
project also in Paratext or Bibledit that is initially empty so that it can receive the target
language text produced by Adapt It.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">In addition, since Adapt It has the ability
to create </font><strong><font color="#000000">free translations</font></strong><font color="#000000">,
you may want to create another empty Paratext or Bibledit
project to receive the free translations. </font>
</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Collaboration between Adapt It and either
Paratext or Bibledit means that the strengths of both translation
applications are available to the translator in a relatively seamless
process. When collaborating with Paratext or Bibledit, Adapt It
creates and maintains its own projects in project folders - just as
it did in previous versions of Adapt It. But when collaborating with
Paratext or Bibledit, Adapt It automatically handles the
transfer of source texts from Paratext or Bibledit to Adapt It's
own project </font><strong><font color="#000000">and</font></strong><font color="#000000">
it automatically handles the transfer of adapted/target texts (and
free translations) back to the appropriate Paratext or Bibledit
projects, where they can be revised, checked and polished in Paratext
or Bibledit.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">One other difference between Adapt It
and the other programs is that Adapt It is stores documents
at the chapter or book level. Paratext stores documents at the
book level only. Bibledit stores documents at the chapter level only.
The collaboration process knows about this difference and is able to
accommodate it. However, it does have implication for the planning
process by the administrator. You need to plan ahead in determining
what books are to be translated</font> and the approach you want to
use. <strong>The AI team recommends that you use a chapter by chapter
approach consistently</strong>. Therefore working in collaboration
uses the chapter by chapter approach by default. This means that,
although Adapt It uses smaller units in its own AI
project, collaboration mode keeps the Paratext texts in book units,
and the Bibledit texts in their chapter units.</p>
<p>Thus any organization method is supported. However, once you
decide to use a book or a chapter as an adaptation unit you should
keep using that unit throughout the work in a project. For a given
book, you should not do adaptation work part of the time using the
whole book approach and part of the time using a chapter by
chapter approach. </p>
<p>Note: On some low power computers with relatively slow processors,
we recommend that you use the chapter by chapter approach, since
working in whole book mode for collaboration may operate more slowly,
especially for document loading and saving.</p>

<h2 class="western"><a name="Automatically"></a>Automatically
exchange Scripture files with Paratext or Bibledit</h2>
<p>If you use Paratext 7, Paratext 8, Paratext 9, or Bibledit, you can now set up
Adapt It to collaborate directly with <a href="#Paratext_Steps_Start">Paratext</a>
or <a href="#Bibledit_Steps_Start">Bibledit</a> . Here are the steps:</p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="Paratext_Steps_Start"></a>Paratext</h2>
<h3 class="western">Important Note to Paratext 7 Users Upgrading to
Paratext 8 or Paratext 9: 
</h3>
<p><strong>If you have previously set up Adapt It to collaborate with
Paratext 7, and have upgraded to Paratext 8 or Paratext 9, you should do the
following before you attempt to continue collaboration work between
Adapt It and Paratext: </strong>
</p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>First be sure that you
	have migrated all the Paratext projects used in collaboration work
	from Paratext 7 to Paratext 8. You must use the procedures within
	Paratext 8 to migrate the Paratext 7 projects that Adapt It was
	using previously during collaboration work - migrating those
	projects from the Paratext 7 installation over to the new Paratext 8
	installation. These Paratext projects include the Paratext project
	that was being used for obtaining Adapt It's &quot;source texts&quot;,
	the Paratext project that was being used for receiving Adapt It's
	&quot;target texts&quot; - as well as any Paratext project that was
	being used for receiving &quot;free translations&quot; generated
	within Adapt It. </strong>
	</p>
	<li/>
<p><strong>You should then make sure that you have upgraded
	Adapt It to version 6.8.2 or newer. Version 6.8.2 fixes a few
	potential collaboration problems since version 6.8.0. Versions of
	Adapt It earlier than 6.8.0 will NOT collaborate with Paratext 8. </strong>
	</p>
</ol>
<p><strong>If you do these two things, Adapt It 6.8.2 or newer should
be able to continue collaborating with the same Paratext language
projects that have been migrated to Paratext 8 - without needing to
change any collaboration settings within Adapt It. If you encounter
any problems after upgrading from Paratext 7 to Paratext 8, and after
migrating the user's Paratext language projects to Paratext 8, you
may need to display the Administrator menu within Adapt It, choose
&quot;Setup or Remove Collaboration...&quot; and follow the steps in
that dialog to setup collaboration between Adapt It and the version
of Paratext that is being actively used. </strong>
</p>
<h3 class="western">1. Ensure the needed versions of Adapt It (6.8.2
or newer is best) and either Paratext 7 (7.4 or newer), or Paratext 8, 
or Paratext 9 are installed</h3>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: For Adapt It to collaborate with
Paratext, you need to <strong>install version 7.4 or newer of
Paratext and version 6.8.2 or newer of Adapt It</strong>. (Older
versions of Adapt It from 6.2.1 and onwards supported collaboration
to some extent, but for best results please use the most recent
version of Adapt It available at <a href="http://adapt-it.org./">http://adapt-it.org.</a>
If your version of Adapt It is not at least 6.6.4 or newer, you will
need to download and install it. If you have upgraded to Paratext 8, or Paratext 9,
you will need to upgrade to Adapt It version 6.8.2 or newer to
continue collaboration work with Paratext 8/9 projects. 
</p>
<h3 class="western">2. Prepare at least two Paratext projects
for collaboration with Adapt It</h3>
<p><strong>BEFORE</strong> you set up Adapt It to collaborate with
Paratext, you should ensure that Paratext has at least <strong>TWO</strong>
projects set up -- one project for obtaining <strong>source</strong>
texts, and a different project to receive the <strong>translation
drafts</strong> produced by Adapt It. (You may also want to have a
third project set up within Paratext for storing <strong>Free
translations</strong>.) The <strong>source</strong> project needs to
have completed texts, either imported from a source or completed in
Paratext. It is best if you include <em>all </em>texts that that
are to be translated in the project. However, you can add books
piecemeal to Paratext as the work progresses, and Adapt It will
accommodate that happily.  </p>
<p>The project(s) that are to receive the translation draft (and free
translation, if desired) need to be established as well. These
projects need to contain &quot;<strong>empty</strong> &quot; books
which include the chapter and verse USFM markers. There needs to be
an empty book to correspond to each of the books in the source
project. The USFM markers are necessary for Adapt It to properly
place the draft translations.</p>

	</table>
</center>
<p><br/>
As you create the projects it is important to ensure that
the <strong>Language</strong> field is set correctly in Paratext's
<strong>Project Properties and Settings</strong> dialog for each
Paratext project in the Adapt It collaboration. Press the
<strong>Edit/View...</strong> or the <strong>New...</strong> button
to enter a unique language name for each project. Paratext
provides you with a small set of defined languages and if one of
your languages is not in the defined list, you can establish a new
one by pressing the <strong>New...</strong> button. Therefore, if
the collaboration project has the objective of
translating <strong>Swahili</strong> texts to <strong>English</strong>, the
&quot;source&quot; project's <strong>Language</strong> field should
be set to <strong>Swahili</strong>. In the same way, the &quot;target
texts&quot; project's <strong>Language</strong> field should be set
to <strong>English</strong>.<strong> </strong>You may need to
establish Swahili as a &quot;new&quot; language; however, English is
a  Paratext predefined language. Free translation projects may
be in the same language as the target project or in a different
language for reading by a consultant.</p>
<h3 class="western">3. Setup Adapt It - Paratext Collaboration</h3>
<p>The next step is to set up the collaboration in Adapt It. This
process takes place using the <strong>Administrator</strong> menu.</p>
<p align="center"> <img border="0" src="Images/Admin_help/AdminMenuSetupPTCollab.gif" width="300" height="240" alt="Administrator Menu"/>

</p>
<p align="left">When you select &quot;Setup or Remove
Collaboration...&quot; the following dialog appears:</p>
<center>
	<table width="389" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
		<tr>
			<td style="border: none; padding: 0in">
				<p><img border="0" src="Images/Admin_help/SetupOrRemoveCollabWinArrows.gif" width="870" height="691" alt="Repect boundaries" >

			<td style="border: none; padding: 0in">
				<p align="center">The &quot;Set Up or Remove Collaboration&quot;
				dialog</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</center>
<p><br/>
You should follow the 4 numbered steps as shown on this
dialog:</p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p>Select an existing Adapt It project from the drop-down list
	that you want to use for collaboration. If the Adapt It project does
	not yet exist you can click on the &quot;Create New Adapt It
	Project&quot; button to create an empty Adapt It project for Adapt
	It to use in the collaboration process. An Adapt It project
	is needed to keep its adaptation documents during
	collaboration. If you select an Adapt It project that has
	previously been configured for collaboration, its collaboration
	settings will appear in the data fields in Step 3.</p>
	<li/>
<p>The choices for Scripture Editor will depend on which
	programs are installed on your computer, and whether you previously
	had collaboration working on your computer. The possible
	editors that Adapt It can collaborate with are Paratext 7, Paratext
	8, Paratext 9, and Bibledit. If you computer has multiple versions of 
	Paratext (7,8, or 9) installed with valid language
	projects those versions of Paratext will be enabled as
	valid choices under Scripture Editor. If your computer has Bibledit
	installed the &quot;Bibledit&quot; choice will be available. If only 
	one editor is installed and so only one choice will
	be available. <strong>Verify that the Paratext or Bibledit projects
	that you want Adapt It to collaborate with have already been created
	within Paratext</strong> <strong>or Bibledit</strong>. A minimum of
	<strong>at least two projects</strong> are required: One project for
	obtaining source texts for adaptation work in Adapt It; and a
	different project to receive the adapted texts produced by Adapt It.
	If the user wants to create a &quot;free translation&quot; in
	addition to an adaptation, you need to have a third project set up
	to receive free translations.</p>
	<p>The Paratext/Bibledit projects need to have ALL of the books that
	are to be adapted in the overall project. This means that you
	need to import all available source text books into
	the Paratext/Bibledit source text project. In the project that
	is to receive adapted texts, you should <strong>create</strong> the
	same set of books as in the source project. When creating books in
	the projects for receiving translated drafts or free translations,
	they should be created <strong>empty</strong>, but <strong>with
	chapter and verse numbers</strong> (the default).</p>
	<p>Each line in the list in step 2 displays a single Paratext or
	Bibledit project. For Paratext 7, 8, or 9, the list
	lines have up to four parts separated by colon characters (:). The
	first part is the Paratext &quot;Short Name&quot;. The second part
	is the Paratext &quot;Full Name&quot; for that project. The third
	part is the &quot;Language&quot; name. The fourth part (if it
	has been defined within Paratext) is the language code for that
	project. Bibledit projects have a single part which is generally the
	same name as the Bibledit project. Important: If you do not see
	the expected projects for the editor button selected, you should
	STOP at this point in the Adapt It setup. Close the Setup
	Collaboration dialog (without saving any changes), and go back
	to Paratext or Bibledit to do the necessary setup. You will not be
	able to complete the Adapt It setup using this dialog until the
	necessary Paratext 7, 8, 9, or Bibledit projects exist.</p>
	<li/>
<p>Once you have ensured that the necessary projects have been
	created, you need to <strong>choose at least two of those projects
	using the &quot;Select ... Project from List&quot; buttons</strong>
	shown in step 3. Click on the &quot;Select Source Project from List&quot;
	button and select the project from which source texts will be
	obtained during collaboration. Wait a few seconds for Adapt It to analyze the
	books available in that project and report on what it finds. The
	status bar at the bottom of the Adapt It screen shows the progress
	as Adapt It analyzes the books. Then click on the &quot;Select
	Target Project from List&quot; button and select a
	different project which is to receive translation drafts during
	collaboration. Again, wait for Adapt It to analyze and report on the
	books available in that project. If you have set up a third project
	to receive free translations, use the third button &quot;Select Free
	Translation Project from List&quot; to select that project. The
	projects selected will appear in the dialog to the left of the
	&quot;Select ... Project from List&quot; buttons. If you
	accidentally selected a project for receiving free translations, you
	can clear that project's selection using the &quot;No Free
	Translation&quot; button. <br/>
<br/>
3a. The &quot;Get by Chapter
	Only&quot; option is the recommended method of retrieving text
	during collaboration. However, when doing adaptations between two
	closely related dialects that involve few changes between the source
	text and target text, a more efficient work flow may result by
	selecting &quot;Get by Whole Book&quot;. Note: The loading and
	saving of documents in &quot;Whole Book&quot; collaboration will
	take noticeably more time, especially on slower computers and for
	books that contain many chapters such as Matthew, Luke, Acts,
	Psalms, etc.</p>
	<li/>
<p>Click on the &quot;Accept this setup and prepare for
	another&quot; button to save this collaboration scenario in the
	Adapt It' project configuration file. Adapt It will verify that the
	setup configuration has been saved. The data fields of the dialog
	now become empty in case you want to set up another collaboration
	projects while working in this dialog. If you have selected an Adapt
	It project in Step 1 that has previously been configured for
	collaboration its settings will appear in the data fields of Step 3.
	If for some reason you want to remove the collaboration settings for
	the selected Adapt It project, you can do so by clicking the &quot;Remove
	this AI Project from Collaboration&quot; button.</p>
</ol>
<p>When you have finished configuring collaboration setups, click on
the Close button to close the &quot;Setup Collaboration&quot; dialog.
The Start Working Wizard will appear. You can now test how the
application will work for the user. From the wizard's &quot;Select a
Project&quot; page, select a project that you have just configured
for collaboration.</p>
<p>You will then see what the user sees when opening that
project - a dialog that looks like this:</p>
<p align="center"> <img border="0" src="Images/Admin_help/ChooseCollabOptionsDlg.gif" width="350" height="157" alt="Choose how you want to work with this project" >
</p>
<p><br/>
The user has three options for entering a project that
you have configured for collaboration. The three options correspond
to the three radio buttons in the above dialog. The first two buttons
are designed to allow the user to decide whether he wants to work
on texts in that project with collaboration on or off. When he
elects to &quot;Work with my Paratext Scripture texts
(Collaboration on)&quot; and clicks the OK button, the
wizard will close and he will see the main book/chapter
selection dialog (see below). If he elects to &quot;Work
with other Adapt It texts (Paratext texts not available:
Collaboration off)&quot; the wizard will continue on to the &quot;Select
a Document&quot; page of the wizard, where he can then select any
non-collaboration documents that are available for adaptation
work. With collaboration turned off the user will work
with Adapt It, adapting non-collaboration texts in the same
way that Adapt It worked before its collaboration features were
added in version 6. Thus, a single Adapt It project may
contain documents that are created both when collaboration is
on, and when collaboration is turned off. When collaboration is
turned on, the user never needs to interact with any documents -
he only chooses scripture books and chapters (see below). When
collaboration is turned off for the same Adapt It project, the user
will see and interact with only non-collaboration documents
using the &quot;Select a Document&quot; page of the wizard.<br/>
<br/>
The
third option for entering a project is designed for advisors and
consultants to use. It is labeled &quot;Read-only mode (All
texts accessible but not editable - I'm an advisor or consultant)&quot;.
When this option is selected, collaboration mode remains off and the
&quot;Select a Document&quot; page of the wizard appears. In this
case all documents, both collaboration documents (whose names begin
with &quot;_Collab...&quot;) and non-collaboration documents will
appear in the list of documents, and any of them can be opened.
However, with this third option in effect, all documents opened
will be in read-only mode. This mode is designed so that an advisor
or consultant can view the user's work without risk of making any
unintended changes. When in this mode, the background of the main
Adapt It window will be pink as a reminder that read-only mode is in
effect and any changes made in that mode cannot be saved, but will be
lost when the document is closed.</p>
<p>When the user selects &quot;Work with my Paratext Scripture texts
(Collaboration on)&quot;, after a short pause the following
collaboration dialog will appear:</p>
<p align="center"> <img border="0" src="Images/Admin_help/GetSourceTextFromEditorNoOptions.gif" width="550" height="357" alt="Get source test from Paratext project" >
</p>
<p>This is the main dialog that the user will see when collaboration
is turned on for the given project. From this simple dialog the
user can select a Scripture book and chapter for collaboration. The
dialog shows a list of the scripture books available in
Paratext's Source Project. It also shows the chapters for the
book together with information about the status of the target text as
it is currently stored in Paratext's Target Project. The user can
select any Paratext book and chapter to work on. When OK is
clicked, Adapt It automatically fetches the source text and any
existing target text from Paratext and displays them in Adapt
It's main window, ready to continue the adaptation process. When work
is saved within Adapt It, Adapt It automatically transfers
the saved target translation back to the appropriate Paratext
project. If a Paratext project is set up for storing free
translations, those are also saved in the appropriate Paratext
project.</p>
<p>In the past working chapter by chapter in Adapt It and then moving
the results to Paratext involved a lot of manual work -- copying and
joining chapter files together into whole books and copying them back
and forth between Adapt It and Paratext. Not any more! Adapt It knows
how to handle the consolidation of books into chapters and how to
break books into chapters. All the details and organization of files
are processed behind the scenes and invisible to the user. During
collaboration work the user never needs to navigate around in the
computer's file system and never needs to find or copy or move files.</p>
<p>Note: When Adapt It works in collaboration with Paratext, it not
only transfers data between Adapt It and the selected Paratext
projects -- it also maintains its own collaboration project in the
computer's &quot;Adapt It Unicode Work&quot; folder (or Adapt It Work
folder for the non-Unicode version). If the Adapt It project has
already been established and work has already been done in the two
languages, the collaboration project can take advantage of the
previously developed project knowledge base. The collaboration
project continues to develop the knowledge base. You should be aware
however that you can not continue to work on previously created
documents while Adapt It is in collaboration mode. Collaboration mode
must turned off to work in standard Adapt It documents.</p>

<h3 class="western">1. Ensure that the necessary versions of Adapt It
(6.3.5 or newer) and Bibledit (4.3 or newer) are installed</h3>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: If you used Adapt It version 6.0.x or
6.1.x previously, please note that as of version 6.2.1, collaboration
with Bibledit can now be setup for individual Adapt It projects, and
it is now the user's decision as to whether to turn collaboration on
or off for a given Adapt It project. Therefore, if you have
previously used version 6.0.x or 6.1.x of Adapt It for collaboration
with Bibledit, your collaboration settings will be preserved in
upgrading to 6.2.1, but please review the section below carefully for
differences in how collaboration is now setup and used.</p>
<p>For Adapt It to collaborate with Bibledit, you need to <strong>install
version 6.2.1 or newer of Adapt It and version 4.3 or newer of
Bibledit-gtk</strong>. The current version of Adapt It packaged
in the SIL repositories can handle collaboration, and the current
version of Bibledit that is in the Ubuntu repositories can also
handle collaboration with Adapt It. Do the following steps:</p>
<p><strong>a.</strong> Start up <strong>Synaptic Package
Manager. </strong>It should be located in the System &gt;
Administration menu (If it is not there or you are using Unity, which
doesn't install it by default, you can find the Synaptic
Package Manager by clicking on &quot;Ubuntu Software Center&quot;. In
the Ubuntu Software Center's Search box type &quot;Synaptic&quot;,
then click on the &quot;Synaptic Package Manager&quot; item when it
appears and click on &quot;Install&quot;).</p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> In the Synaptic Package Manager application
click on the <strong>Settings &gt; Repositories</strong>. Click on
the &quot;<strong>Other Software</strong>&quot; tab. Examine the list
of software repositories. If there is not already a line that
contains a reference to <strong>http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu ...</strong>,
then click on the &quot;Add...&quot; button at the bottom. Then enter
<strong>one</strong> of the following lines depending on which
distribution of Ubuntu Linux is installed on your machine:</p>
<p>deb http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu precise main<br/>
deb
http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu trusty main<br/>
deb
http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu utopic main<br/>
deb
http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu vivid main<br/>
deb
http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu wily main<br/>
deb
http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu xenial main<br/>
deb
http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu yakkety main</p>
<p><strong>c.</strong> Close the Software Sources, and return to the
Synaptic Package Manager, <strong>click on &quot;Reload&quot;</strong>
to insure you have the latest information from the repositories. If
you get an error, check that you have entered the correct line into
your Other Software (step b above).</p>
<p><strong>d.</strong> Click on the &quot;Search&quot; button and
type <strong>adaptit</strong> in the search box. When the adaptit
packages appear, look at the &quot;Installed Version&quot; and
&quot;Latest Version&quot; columns. Ensure that the version listed
for adaptit is <strong>at least 6.2.1, but preferably 6.5.3 or later</strong>.
If the &quot;Latest Version&quot; (if no version of adaptit is at
least 6.2.1 make sure you have set up the
http://packages.sil.org/ubuntu line correctly in the Synaptic Package
Manager's Software Sources setup in step b above). If no version is
listed in the &quot;Installed Version&quot;, or if the &quot;Latest
Version&quot; is newer than the &quot;Installed Version&quot;
listed you should mark the adaptit is entries for installation or
upgrade. To mark the adaptit and adaptit-docs packages, right click
on them and select &quot;Mark for Installation&quot; or &quot;Mark
for Upgrade&quot; from the popup menu. Select the &quot;Mark&quot;
button in the warning dialog. Then click on the &quot;Apply&quot;
button at the top of the Synaptic Package Manager application, and
click on the &quot;Apply&quot; button on the Summary dialog. Close
Synaptic Package Manager after it completes the installation of Adapt
It.</p>
<p><strong>e.</strong> In the Synaptic Package Manager application
click on the &quot;Search&quot; button and type <strong>bibledit-gtk</strong>
in the search box. When the bibledit-gtk and bibledit-gtk-data
packages appear, look at the &quot;Installed Version&quot; and
&quot;Latest Version&quot; columns. Ensure that the version listed
for bibledit is <strong>at least 4.3</strong>. If no version is
listed in the &quot;Installed Version&quot;, or if the &quot;Latest
Version&quot; is newer than the &quot;Installed Version&quot;
listed you should mark the bibledit-gtk and bibledit-gtk-data entries
for installation or upgrade. To mark the bibledit-gtk and
bibledit-gtk-data packages, right click on them and select &quot;Mark
for Installation&quot; or &quot;Mark for Upgrade&quot; from the popup
menu. Select the &quot;Mark&quot; button in the warning dialog. Then
click on the &quot;Apply&quot; button at the top of the Synaptic
Package Manager application, and click on the &quot;Apply&quot;
button on the Summary dialog. Close Synaptic Package Manager after it
completes the installation of bibledit-gtk.</p>
<p>After their installation, both Adapt It and Bibledit-Gtk
should be listed in the Office menu (or can be found by searching for
adaptit or bibledit on Unity's Desk Home search bar). The next step
is to ensure that you have your Bibledit projects (at least two)
setup within Bibledit.</p>
<h3 class="western">2. Prepare at least two Bibledit projects for
collaboration with Adapt It</h3>
<p><strong>BEFORE</strong> you set up Adapt It to collaborate with
Bibledit, you should ensure that Bibledit has at least <strong>TWO</strong>
projects set up - one project for obtaining <strong>source</strong>
texts, and a different project to receive the <strong>translation
drafts</strong> produced by Adapt It. You may also want to have a
third project set up within Bibledit for storing <strong>Free
translations</strong> . These projects should be set up, complete
with books either imported or created within Bibledit <strong>BEFORE</strong>
you set up Adapt It to collaborate with Bibledit. Select File &gt;
Project &gt; New to access Bibledit's &quot;Project properties&quot;
dialog. It looks like this:</p>
<center>
	<table width="412" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
		<tr>
			<td style="border: none; padding: 0in">
<p align="center"> <img border="0" src="Images/Admin_help/BENewProject.gif" width="400" height="318" alt="Bibledit project properties" >

				<p align="center">The Bibledit &quot;Project properties&quot;
				dialog</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</center>
<p align="left">Note: You can ignore the Language setting field shown
above during the setup for collaboration. If you know how to set up a
customized Bibledit language name you can do so; but because of the
difficulty for most users, Adapt It does not make use of the
&quot;Language&quot; setting here in the Bibledit
Project's properties dialog. Instead Adapt It will allow
you to define the language names it will use for the
Bibledit projects participating in the collaboration process
(see below).</p>
<p>Important: As an administrator you should have a long term goal in
mind when creating the Bibledit projects and the books for those
projects. You should <strong>import</strong> into the Bibledit
project used for source texts ALL books that may eventually be
adapted using Adapt It. In the Bibledit project that is to receive
adapted texts, you should <strong>create</strong> ALL the books
that may ever be translated now at the beginning of the project. When
creating books in the Bibledit projects for receiving translated
drafts or free translations, they should be created empty, but <strong>with
chapter and verse numbers</strong> (the Bibledit default). To do
this, after you add a book, use the &quot;+ Templates&quot; button to
get the book's chapters setup with USFM markers without any text
content.

	</table>
</center>
<p><br/>
You should follow the 4 numbered steps as shown on this
dialog:</p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p>Select an existing Adapt It project from the drop-down list
	that you want to use for collaboration. If the Adapt It project does
	not yet exist you can click on the &quot;Create New Adapt It
	Project&quot; button to create an empty Adapt It project for Adapt
	It to use in the collaboration process. An Adapt It project
	is needed to keep its adaptation documents during
	collaboration. If you select an Adapt It project that has
	previously been configured for collaboration, its collaboration
	settings will appear in the data fields in Step 3.</p>
	<li/>
<p>The choices for Scripture Editor will depend on which
	programs are installed on your computer, and whether you previously
	had collaboration working on your computer. If your computer has
	both Paratext and Bibledit installed both the &quot;Paratext&quot;
	and &quot;Bibledit&quot; choices will be available, but usually only
	one choice will be available. <strong>Verify that the Bibledit or
	Bibledit projects have already been created within Bibledit or
	Paratext</strong>. A minimum of <strong>at least two projects</strong>
	are required: One project for obtaining source texts for adaptation
	work in Adapt It; and a different project to receive the adapted
	texts produced by Adapt It. If the user will be creating a free
	translation in addition to an adaptation, you need to have a third
	project set up to receive free translations.<br/>
<br/>
The
	Paratext/Bibledit projects need to have ALL of the books that are to
	be adapted in the overall project. This means that you
	need to import all available source text books into
	the Paratext/Bibledit source text project. In the project that is to
	receive adapted texts, you should <strong>create</strong> the same
	set of books as in the source project. When creating books in the
	projects for receiving translated drafts or free translations, they
	should be created <strong>empty</strong> , but <strong>with
	chapter and verse numbers</strong> (the default).<br/>
<br/>
Each
	line in the list displays a single Paratext or Bibledit project. For
	Paratext, the list lines have up to four parts separated by colon
	characters (:). The first part is the Paratext &quot;Short Name&quot;.
	The second part is the Paratext &quot;Full Name&quot; for that
	project. The third part is the &quot;Language&quot; name. The fourth
	part (if it has been defined within Paratext) is the language
	code for that project. Bibledit projects have a single part which is
	generally the same name as the Bibledit project. Important: If
	you do not see the projects listed that your user will need to use
	in collaboration, you should STOP at this point in the Adapt It
	setup. Cancel from the Setup Collaboration dialog and do the
	necessary setup of the Paratext or Bibledit projects first. You will
	not be able to complete the Adapt It setup using this dialog until
	the necessary Paratext or Bibledit projects already exist.</p>
	<li/>
<p>Once you have ensured that the necessary projects have been
	created, you need to <strong>select at least two of those projects
	using the &quot;Select ... Project from List&quot; buttons</strong>
	shown in step 3. Click on the &quot;Select Source Project from List&quot;
	button and select the project from which source texts will be
	obtained during collaboration. Then click on the &quot;Select Target
	Project from List&quot; button and select a different project
	which is to receive translation drafts during collaboration. If you
	have set up a third project to receive free translations, use the
	third button &quot;Select Free Translation Project from List&quot;
	to select that project. The projects selected will appear in the
	dialog to the left of the &quot;Select ... Project from List&quot;
	buttons. If you accidentally selected a project for receiving free
	translations, you can clear that project's selection using the &quot;No
	Free Translation&quot; button.<br/>
<br/>
3a. The &quot;Get by
	Chapter Only&quot; option is the recommended method of retrieving
	text during collaboration. However, when doing adaptations between
	two closely related dialects that involve few changes between the
	source text and target text, a more efficient work flow may result
	by selecting &quot;Get by Whole Book&quot;. Note: The loading and
	saving of documents in &quot;Whole Book&quot; collaboration will
	take noticeably more time, especially on slower computers and for
	books that contain many chapters such as Matthew, Luke, Acts,
	Psalms, etc.</p>
	<li/>
<p>Click on the &quot;Accept this setup and prepare for
	another&quot; button to save this collaboration scenario in the
	Adapt It' project configuration file. Adapt It will verify that the
	setup configuration has been saved. The data fields of the dialog
	now become empty in case you want to set up another collaboration
	projects while working in this dialog. If you have selected an Adapt
	It project in Step 1 that has previously been configured for
	collaboration its settings will appear in the data fields of Step 3.
	If for some reason you want to remove the collaboration settings for
	the selected Adapt It project, you can do so by clicking the &quot;Remove
	this AI Project from Collaboration&quot; button.</p>
</ol>
<p>When have finished configuring collaboration setups, click on the
Close button to close the &quot;Setup Collaboration&quot;
dialog. The Start Working Wizard will appear. You can now test
how the application will work for the user. From the wizard's &quot;Select
a Project&quot; page, select a project that you have just configured
for collaboration.</p>
<p>You will then see what the user sees when opening that
project - a dialog that looks like this: </p>
<p align="center"> <img border="0" src="Images/Admin_help/ChooseCollabOptionsDlg_BE.gif" width="400" height="159" alt="Choose how you want to work with this project" >
</p>
<p>The user has three options for entering a project that you
have configured for collaboration. The three options correspond to
the three radio buttons in the above dialog. The first two buttons
are designed to allow the user to decide whether he wants to work
on texts in that project with collaboration on or off. When he
elects to &quot;Work with my Bibledit Scripture texts
(Collaboration on)&quot; and clicks the OK button, the
wizard will close and he will see the main book/chapter
selection dialog (see below). If he elects to &quot;Work
with other Adapt It texts (Bibledit texts not available:
Collaboration off)&quot; the wizard will continue on to the &quot;Select
a Document&quot; page of the wizard, where he can then select any
non-collaboration documents that are available for adaptation
work. With collaboration turned off the user will work
with Adapt It, adapting non-collaboration texts in the same
way that Adapt It worked before its collaboration features were
added in version 6. Thus, a single Adapt It project may
contain documents that are created both when collaboration is
on, and when collaboration is turned off. When collaboration is
turned on, the user never needs to interact with any documents -
he only chooses scripture books and chapters (see below). When
collaboration is turned off for the same Adapt It project, the user
will see and interact with only non-collaboration documents
using the &quot;Select a Document&quot; page of the wizard.<br/>
<br/>
The
third option for entering a project is designed for advisors and
consultants to use. It is labeled &quot;Read-only mode (All
texts accessible but not editable - I'm an advisor or consultant)&quot;.
When this option is selected, collaboration mode remains off and the
&quot;Select a Document&quot; page of the wizard appears. In this
case all documents, both collaboration documents (whose names begin
with &quot;_Collab...&quot;) and non-collaboration documents will
appear in the list of documents, and any of them can be opened.
However, with this third option in effect, all documents opened
will be in read-only mode. This mode is designed so that an advisor
or consultant can view the user's work without risk of making any
unintended changes. When in this mode, the background of the main
Adapt It window will be pink as a reminder that read-only mode is in
effect and any changes made in that mode cannot be saved, but will be
lost when the document is closed.</p>
<p>When the user selects &quot;Work with my Bibledit Scripture texts
(Collaboration on)&quot;, after a short pause the following
collaboration dialog will appear:</p>
<p align="center"> <img border="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Get_src_text_from_BE_proj_no_options_showing.gif" width="550" height="300" alt="Get source text from Bibledit project" >
</p>
<p>This is the main dialog that the user will see when collaboration
is turned on for the given project. From this simple dialog the
user can select a Scripture book and chapter for collaboration. The
dialog shows a list of the scripture books available in Bibledit's
Source Project. It also shows the chapters for the book together with
information about the status of the target text as it is currently
stored in Bibledit's Target Project. The user can select any Bibledit
book and chapter to work on. When OK is clicked, Adapt It
automatically fetches the source text and any existing target
text from Bibledit and displays them in Adapt It's main window,
ready to continue the adaptation process. When work is saved within
Adapt It, Adapt It automatically transfers the saved target
translation back to the appropriate Bibledit project. If a Bibledit
project is set up for storing free translations, those are also saved
in the appropriate Bibledit project.</p>
<p>In the past working chapter by chapter in Adapt It and then moving
the results to Bibledit involved a lot of manual work -- copying and
joining chapter files together into whole books and copying them back
and forth between Adapt It and Bibledit. Not any more! Adapt It knows
how to handle the consolidation of books into chapters and how to
break books into chapters. All the details and organization of files
are processed behind the scenes and invisible to the user. During
collaboration work the user never needs to navigate around in the
computer's file system and never needs to find or copy or move files.</p>
<p>Note: When Adapt It works in collaboration with Bibledit, it not
only transfers data between Adapt It and the selected Bibledit
projects -- it also maintains its own collaboration project in the
computer's &quot;Adapt It Unicode Work&quot; folder (or Adapt It Work
folder for the non-Unicode version). If the Adapt It project has
already been established and work has already been done in the two
languages, the collaboration project can take advantage of the
previously developed project knowledge base. The collaboration
project continues to develop the knowledge base. You should be aware
however that you can not continue to work on previously created
documents while Adapt It is in collaboration mode. Collaboration mode
must turned off to work in standard Adapt It documents.</p>

<h2 class="western"><a name="Protect_Paratext"></a>Protect Paratext&rsquo;s
or Bibledit&rsquo;s advanced drafts from being overwritten by older
draft versions when updating the old drafts and the Adapt It
knowledge base.</h2>
<p>Adapt It now has a new collaboration document data transfer
protection feature. Teams who use Adapt It to collaborate with
Paratext or Bibledit to translate drafts of Scripture books
eventually stop adapting/drafting those books within Adapt It, and
just continue the revision of those Scripture books (and chapters) in
Paratext or Bibledit. However, once such books have reached an
advanced/polished state (and perhaps consultant checked), it can be
very beneficial to open the old drafts of those books again in Adapt
It and update the old drafts in the Adapt It project to include the
revisions that were done to those documents in Paratext/Bibledit. By
doing so, those revisions and updates will be stored/updated in Adapt
It's knowledge base for that project, making the knowledge base is
more up-to-date for the drafting of subsequent Scripture books.</p>
<p>When the Adapt It documents are updated within Adapt It for
documents that should not be getting any further changes within the
Paratext or Bibledit project, the team will want to save the changes
in the Adapt It project only, and avoid the transfer of those changes
to Paratext or Bibledit - since such transfers might inadvertently
bring possible editing errors or old renderings over into the
polished documents residing in the Paratext/Bibledit project files.
Adapt It's new collaboration document data transfer protection
feature allows an administrator/user to block such data transfers to
Paratext/Bibledit for specific books and chapters - effectively
&quot;protecting&quot; them in their current state within the
Paratext/Bibledit project.</p>
<p>A typical scenario for the use of this new feature in a
collaboration project between Adapt It and Paratext might proceed as
follows (Steps 1, 2 and 3 below are described in detail in the
<a href="#Paratext_Steps_Start">Paratext setup steps</a> above):</p>
<p>1. The team administrator previously set up two Paratext projects:
Language S, and Language T. Language S is a Paratext project that
contains good quality Source texts for the books that will be adapted
into Language T. The Language T project is also set up within
Paratext and initially has all the books to be translated, but they
are created within Paratext as empty books - containing only chapter
and verse numbers.</p>
<p>2. The team administrator runs Adapt It and sets up a
collaboration project within Adapt It using Adapt It's Administrator
menu item &quot;Setup Or Remove Collaboration...&quot; which provides
a dialog that the administrator uses for creating a new Adapt It
collaboration project (i.e., Language S to Language T adaptations),
and designating which Paratext project is to be used as Adapt It's
source text (in this case the Paratext 'Language S' project), and
which Paratext project is to be used to receive Adapt It's
adaptations/translations/target text (in this case the 'Language T'
Paratext project that was created as &quot;empty&quot; - initially
containing just chapter and verse numbers). The administrator keeps
the default (and recommended) setting to collaborate by &quot;Chapter
Only&quot;.</p>
<p>3. A team translator then runs Adapt It and opens its &quot;Language
S to Language T adaptations&quot; collaboration project, and ensures
that the &quot;Work with my Paratext Scripture text (Collaboration
on)&quot; button is selected (if not pre-selected). The team has
decided this translator should start with the book of Mark, so the
translator selects the book of Mark (if not already pre-selected)
from the &quot;Get Source Text from Paratext Project&quot; dialog.
The translators selects the Chapter to work on (if not pre-selected
from previous work session). Adapt It retrieves the chapter from the
Paratext project's 'Language S' project, and displays it as source
text within the Adapt It main window. The translator (who has learned
to use Adapt It, being trained by the administrator), then adapts the
source text into the target text, benefiting from the increasing
assistance of Adapt It's knowledge base for the &quot;Language S to
Language T adaptations&quot; project. Each time the translators saves
the document within Adapt It, Adapt It saves the adaptation document
locally within the Adapt It collaboration project, AND Adapt It
transfers the newly created 'Language T' target text over to the
Paratext 'Language T' project.</p>
<p>4. The translator reviews and revises the draft of the chapter one
or more times from within Adapt It, and continues the drafting
process opening another chapter of Mark, and adapting it within Adapt
It - until all chapters of Mark have been drafted within Adapt It. In
this 'drafting stage' it is best for the translator to use Adapt It
solely while drafting and doing the initial revision of the chapters,
and refrain from doing any drafting from within Paratext until the
initial drafting and early revision work has been done within Adapt
It for all chapters of the book.</p>
<p>5. At a certain point the translator and administrator decide that
future revision work for the book of Mark should all be done within
Paratext to bring the draft on to a polished or publishable stage. It
is at this point that Adapt It's new data transfer protections
feature can come into play. The administrator makes the Administrator
menu visible within Adapt It and selects the &quot;Manage Data
Transfer Protections to Paratext or Bibledit...&quot; item on the
Administrator menu. The following dialog appears:</p>
<p align="center"> <img border="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Manage_Data_Transfer_Protections1.gif" width="473" height="569" alt="Manage data transfer protections for collaboration editor" >
</p>
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>In the dialog the administrator follows the 3 numbered steps:</p>
<p>(1) Selects an AI collaboration project from the drop-down list -
in our example case it would be the 'Language S to Language T
adaptations' project. The possible books appear in the 'Books' List.</p>
<p>(2) The administrator selects the book of Mark from the 'Books
List' - and the dialog displays the 16 chapters of Mark in the
'Chapters List' with empty check boxes next to each chapter.</p>
<p>(3) The administrator then clicks on the &quot;All Chapters of
Book&quot; button to put ticks in the check boxes of all 16 chapters.</p>
<p>Finally the administrator clicks on OK to save the 'protection'
settings for all chapters of the book of Mark. The draft that exists
in Paratext is now 'protected' in the sense that any changes that get
made back in the chapter documents of Mark within Adapt It will no
longer be transferred to Paratext.</p>
<p>Some teams set up a collaboration project in Adapt It to
collaborate with Paratext in &lsquo;Whole Book&rsquo; mode rather
than in the default &lsquo;Chapter Only&rsquo; mode. In such cases
the &quot;Manage Data Transfer Protections to Paratext or Bibledit&quot;
dialog appears like this:</p>
<p align="center"> <img border="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Manage_Data_Transfer_Protections2.gif" width="435" height="569" alt="Manage data transfer protections for collaboration editor whole book" >
</p>
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>In this version of the dialog the administrator again follows the
3 numbered steps:</p>
<p>(1) Selects an AI collaboration project from the drop-down list -
in our example case it would be the 'Language S to Language T
adaptations' project. The possible books appear in the 'Books' List.</p>
<p>(2) The administrator selects the book of Mark from the 'Books
List'. The &lsquo;Chapters List&rsquo; is disabled since in &lsquo;Whole
Book&rsquo; mode, collaboration only gets whole books from Paratext.</p>
<p>(3) The administrator then clicks on the check box for the book he
wants to &ldquo;protect&rdquo; in Paratext, or alternatively selects
one of the range buttons below the &lsquo;Books List&rsquo; to select
a range of books.</p>
<p>Finally the administrator clicks on OK to save the 'protection'
settings for the whole book(s) selected. The draft that exists in
Paratext is now 'protected' in the sense that any changes that get
made back in the book of Mark within Adapt It will no longer be
transferred to Paratext.</p>
<p>6. The team continues the revision process of the book of Mark
within Paratext until the book has gone through all the revisions to
an advanced/polished state. That polished state might include
consultant checking and even publishing. Up to this point no further
work has been done on the old drafts that still exist in the Adapt It
project.</p>
<p>7. With all the chapters of Mark 'protected', and after the book
of Mark has been revised to an advanced state in Paratext, the
administrator asks the translator to open the old Adapt It 'Language
S to Language T adaptations' project in one desktop window, and
Paratext in another window with the Language T Paratext project
displaying within Paratext, so that the translator can compare the
polished version in Paratext&rsquo;s Language T project with the
&lsquo;target&rsquo; Language T in the old drafts in the Adapt It
project. The administrator asks the translator to open each chapter
(or book for whole book mode) of Mark in Adapt It and compare the old
drafts with the more polished version in Paratext - and make changes
in the Adapt It drafts to make them read as much the same as possible
as the polished version. The purpose of this updating of the draft in
Adapt It is to update Adapt It's knowledge base for that project so
that it contains the updated translations /adaptations that were
added in Paratext after work ceased on the draft in Adapt It. Since
the book of Mark has been marked as &quot;protected from transferring
changes to Paratext&quot; the updating changes will only be saved in
the local Adapt It project, and not transferred to Paratext - thus
&quot;protecting&quot; the advanced Paratext draft from unintended
changes as the translator saves the updates in the chapter documents
of Mark being saved within the Adapt It project. This extra updating
work on the part of the translator will pay off big-time since all
the revisions and updates that were done for the book of Mark in
Paratext will be brought back into Adapt It&rsquo;s knowledge base
and be immediately available for the next book that is
adapted/drafted in that Adapt It collaboration project.</p>
<p>8. A translation team might follow this process for each book
translated, so that each collaboration book in turn can be drafted in
Adapt It, the polishing work done exclusively in Paratext or Bibledit
- the administrator having used this new feature to &quot;protect&quot;
Paratext/Bibledit from any old drafts being transferred or
overwriting the advanced drafts. The translator, by going back to the
old Adapt It drafts and updating those with the more polished
renderings, adds the updates to the Adapt It knowledge base, so that
the knowledge base provides higher quality translation equivalents
when adapting/drafting each new book.</p>
<p>As described above the new feature is available to administrators
for &lsquo;bulk&rsquo; setting of books/chapters through Manage Data
Transfer Protections for Collaboration Editor dialog (from the
Administrator menu). This protection feature is also available in a
more restricted form to non-administrator users via two new menu
items in Adapt It' Advanced menu:</p>
<p>      Prevent Paratext/Bibledit from getting changes to this
document<br/>
      Allow Paratext/Bibledit to get changes to this
document</p>
<p>The above two menu items are enabled in the Advanced menu only
when a collaboration project document is opened within Adapt It. With
these menu items a user can tell Adapt It to &quot;Prevent...&quot;
or &quot;Allow....&quot; changes made in the document transferring
from/to Paratext/Bibledit when Adapt It saves the document. As with
the bulk dialog (available from the Administrator menu), the
protection status for the document is saved and remains in that
protected state unless it is explicitly changed - either by using one
of the two Advanced menu items or by the administrator in the bulk
change dialog from the Administrator menu. The two new Advanced menu
items are limited, because the user can only change the protection
status of the open collaboration document, and cannot change the
protection status for all chapters of a book (or whole book) without
opening each chapter (or book) and invoking one of the above Advanced
menu choices on the open document.

<h2 class="western"><a name="Setup_User_Workflow_Profile"></a>Set up
a User Workflow Profile</h2>
<p>Adapt It has many menu items and features to choose from. Such
choices may be bewildering to a new user or inexperienced user. Adapt
It now allows an administrator to control which choices appear in the
program's interface, and which others remain hidden until such time
as they may be needed. To activate a user workflow profile, <a href="#Setting_up_an_administrator_password">make
the Administrator menu visible</a> , then select User Workflow
Profiles... menu item. The following dialog appears:</p>
<p align="center"> <img border="0" src="Images/Admin_help/User_workflow_profiles.gif" width="400" height="429" alt="Use workflow profiles" >
</p>
<p>This dialog organizes Adapt It's menu selections, Preferences
tabs, Mode bar items, and Tool bar items into four lists or
&quot;profiles&quot; that correspond to the four tabs at
the top of the dialog. Those tabs or profiles are labeled &quot;Novice&quot;,
&quot;Experienced&quot;, &quot;Skilled&quot; and &quot;Custom.&quot;
The list in each tab all contain the same list of items, but we've
pre-selected certain items on each list that we think should be
visible for that profile, and un-selected those items that we think
would be good to remain hidden for the given profile. The Novice
profile starts with most of the listed items hidden (un-ticked). The
Experienced profile makes a few more items visible in the interface
(by ticking more items). The Skilled profile makes many more
interface items visible (by ticking even more items).</p>
<p>Our suggestions are only a starting point; each profile can be
further customized by you, the administrator, to your liking and
according to your knowledge of the skills and needs of the user. If
you select the fourth tab labeled &quot;Custom&quot; Adapt It will
ask you if you want to initialize the selections from one of the
other three profiles as a starting point -- from which you may
continue to customize which interface items are to be shown (ticked),
and which should be hidden (un-ticked).</p>
<p>The default profile setting is &quot;<strong>None</strong>
(keep all menus and settings visible)&quot;. If you want to use a
workflow profile, you first need to click the radio button labeled,
&quot;<strong>Use a workflow profile</strong> (select from drop down
list below)&quot;. This selection enables the drop down box located
below it. Only one profile can be selected at a given time for the
user. You can select the desired profile by using the drop down box
which will allow you to select the Novice, Experienced, Skilled
or the Custom profile. Then, to make the interface start using a
selected profile click on the &quot;Save Changes&quot; button.</p>
<p>At any time you can come back to the User Workflow Profiles dialog
and switch to a different profile or adjust the individual items that
should be visible or hidden for a given profile, and save the
changes.</p>
<p>If you modified the items in a given profile, and now want to
revert that profile to its &quot;factory defaults&quot; you can
do so by first selecting that profile in the drop down box, and then
clicking on the &quot;Revert to factory defaults&quot; button.
If the &quot;Revert to factory defaults&quot; button is disabled, it
means that you have not changed the viewing status of any individual
item in that profile's list.</p>
<p>To stop using a user profile, simply click on the &quot;<strong>None</strong>
(keep all menu and settings visible)&quot; radio button. Adapt It
will remember your settings in case you later decide to reactivate a
workflow profile that you set up previously. As an administrator you
might want to temporarily turn OFF the current user profile, in order
to be able to access all of the interface items while examining the
user's computer. This can now be done via the &quot;Turn OFF the
current user profile temporarily&quot; menu item located in the same
group as the User Wrokflow Profiles... menu item on the Administrator
menu.</p>

<h2 class="western"><a name="Pre_assign_locations_for_inputs_outputs"></a>
Pre-Assign locations for the various kinds of inputs and outputs</h2>
<p>Some computer users find it difficult or confusing to navigate
through a hierarchical file system. They often are not sure where the
files are located that they need to open, or where to save or export
files from Adapt It. They may get lost navigating around the file
system inside a file browser. They may not really know what a file
would be called that they are looking for, nor what a file should be
called when saving or exporting data from Adapt It. Adapt It 6 now
allows you the administrator to pre-assign locations for any and all
the kinds of inputs and outputs that can be done by a user. We call
this a way to &quot;protect&quot; a user from having to do any
navigation of the file system in order to get his work done.</p>
<p>Adapt It now allows you the administrator, to pre-assign locations
for Adapt It's inputs and outputs, and therefore protect the user
from having to compose file names and from having to navigate the
file system to find or save files. To activate these protections,
<a href="#Setting_up_an_administrator_password">make the
Administrator menu visible</a>, then select the <strong>Assign
Locations for Inputs and Outputs...</strong> menu item.</p>
<p>The main dialog appears, which looks like this:</p>
<p align="center"> <img border="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Assign_locations_dlg_nothing_ticked.gif" width="500" height="292" alt="Assign locations for inputs and outputs" >
</p>
<p>By default none of the &quot;Protect from Navigation&quot; check
boxes are ticked. Each of the names in upper case letters and
starting with one or two initial _ underscore characters,
are the names of a standard set of folders that Adapt It 6
automatically creates on the user's computer. These folder locations 
become the default location for the types of data described by the
folder's names. If you as administrator, wish to &quot;protect&quot;
that type of data, you can simply put a tick by as many folder
locations as you want. If you want to protect all the types of data
that Adapt It uses or exports, simply click on the &quot;Protect All
(Check All Boxes)&quot; button.</p>
<p>A setup for a fully protected user (with Paratext collaboration
turned ON) would look like this:</p>
<p align="center"> <img border="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Assign_locations_for_inputs_outputs_all_checked.gif" width="500" height="292" alt="Assign locations for inputs and outputs all boxes ticked" >
</p>
<p>Note: When Adapt It is working in collaboration with Paratext or
Bibledit, Adapt It automatically limits the location for
the source text inputs it obtains for adaptation work, and it
also limits the locations where translation drafts are exported -- to
the Paratext or Bibledit projects that are assigned during
collaboration.  Therefore, if you have previously set up Adapt
It to collaborate with Paratext or Bibledit, the &quot;Protect from
Navigation&quot; check boxes to the right of __SOURCE_INPUTS and
_TARGET_OUTPUTS will indicate (as shown in the dialog immediately
above) that they are &quot;Using Paratext project&quot;; they
will be automatically ticked and cannot be changed. </p>
<p>Again, please understand that if Adapt It is collaborating with
Paratext or Bibledit, SOURCE texts can only be obtained from the
Paratext or Bibledit projects, and Adapt It's TARGET texts (adapted
translation drafts) are automatically transferred  back to
Paratext or Bibledit projects.</p>
<p>However, if your user will <strong>not</strong> be collaborating
with Paratext or Bibledit, you should consider at least selecting the
&quot;Protect from Navigation&quot; for the __SOURCE_INPUTS folder.
When this folder is &quot;protected&quot; the user will only see and
be able to select from a list of input texts for adaptation that are
located in the __SOURCE_INPUTS folder. This can be a very helpful way
to guide the user in what texts to use for adaptation. <strong>Since
the user cannot obtain source text from anywhere else it is important
that you, the advisor, pre-load the __SOURCE_INPUTS folder with the
input texts that the user will need for his or her adaptation work</strong>.
A convenient way to pre-load the __SOURCE_INPUTS folder, it to use
the &quot;<a href="#Moving_or_copying_files_or_folders">Move or Copy
Files Or Folders</a>&quot; dialog from the Administrator menu. This
dialog is designed like a &quot;smart&quot; file browser and knows
what kind of files can be used for adaptation work.</p>
<p>When a folder location has &quot;Protect from Navigation&quot;
activated, Adapt It will not ask the user for a file name nor allow
the user to navigate to a different folder, but will automatically
assign a file name to the input or output file, and read it from or
store it to the indicated location.</p>
<p>The following information is a technical explanation of the way
Adapt It handles the file naming process. You can safely ignore this
section unless you are interested in the details or in the unlikely
circumstance that the file processing does not work properly. In this
case, the following information can be of value in finding out what
went wrong and for conveying to the Adapt It what has happened to the
computer.</p>
<p>When navigation protection is activated for a given input/output
type, Adapt It automatically assigns names to files, it composes the
name based on the type of the file's contents and adds a date-time
&quot;stamp&quot; at the end of the name, and affixes the appropriate
extension. This results in some long file names, but that is of no
concern to the user, because when &quot;Protect from Navigation&quot;
is activated the user doesn't have to interact with files or file
names anyway. For example, the automatically composed name for an RTF
export of the target text might look something like this:</p>
<p><strong>_Target_Text_45_ACT_CH02_exported_2011_07_11T14_25_53Z.rtf</strong>
</p>
<p>and it would be located in the <strong>_TARGET_RTF_OUTPUTS</strong>
folder of the Adapt It project. Because of the presence of the
date-time stamp within the file name, there is never going to be a
danger of files overwriting one another because all exported files
will have unique, easily discernable names, and files with
similar content will sort together in chronological order.</p>
<p>Note: The assignment of text type prefixes and/or date-time stamp
suffixes on file names is not automatically done when navigation
protection is OFF for a given input/output type, but it text type
prefixes and date-time stamp suffixes can be used if desired at
import/export time by ticking the appropriate check boxes on the
dialog that appears.</p>
<p>We suggest that you use the Assign Locations For Inputs and
Outputs dialog to help keep your user's data organized into
predictable locations and its files consistently named - so that they
are easily identified as to content and creation date.</p>
<p>When Adapt It is setup for collaboration with Paratext or
Bibledit, Adapt It keeps a copy of each chapter or book file that it
obtains from Paratext/Bibledit - placing the copy in the
<strong>__SOURCE_INPUTS</strong> folder of the Adapt It project that
is hooked up to Paratext/Bibledit during collaboration. The files
that Adapt It puts in the __SOURCE_INPUTS folder are named
automatically by Adapt It, and will have a _Collab_ prefix on the
name. A chapter file for chapter 2 of the book of Matthew
obtained from Paratext or Bibledit will be named similar to the
following example:</p>
<p><strong>_Collab_41_MAT_CH02.txt</strong> 
</p>
<p>If collaboration is done by whole book, a file obtained
from Paratext or Bibledit will be named similar to the following
example:</p>
<p><strong>_Collab_41_MAT.txt</strong> 
</p>
<p>The adaptation documents that Adapt It creates - regardless of
whether collaboration is ON or OFF, are still stored in the
&quot;<strong>Adaptations</strong>&quot; folder of the Adapt It
project. When collaboration is turned ON, those files are
automatically named by Adapt It. The adaptation document for Matthew
chapter 2 would be called:</p>
<p><strong>_Collab_41_MAT_CH02.xml</strong> 
</p>
<p>and the adaptation document for the whole book of Matthew would be
called:</p>
<p><strong>_Collab_41_MAT.xml</strong> 
</p>
<p>in either case these xml formatted adaptation documents are
always located in the <strong>Adaptations</strong> folder of the
Adapt It project.</p>

<h2 class="western"><a name="Moving_or_copying_files_or_folders"></a>Moving
or copying files or folders.</h2>
<p>As an administrator you may have a need to move or copy files from
within Adapt It. Adapt It 6 provides an &quot;intelligent&quot; file
browser for administrative use. To get Adapt It's file browser, <a href="#Setting_up_an_administrator_password">make
the Administrator menu visible</a>, then select the &quot;Move Or
Copy Folders Or Files...&quot; menu item. When you do so the
following dual pane dialog appears:</p>
<p align="center"> <img border="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Move_or_Copy_Folders_or_Files.gif" width="500" height="311" alt="Move or copy folders or files" >
</p>
<p>Note that generally, if your users are going to be working with
Adapt It in collaboration with Paratext or Bibledit, you probably do
not need to worry about moving or copying files or folders for Adapt
It's use. In collaboration work the main data you will be concerned
about will be the data kept in the Paratext or Bibledit data store.
In collaboration mode Adapt It becomes an adaptation engine for
Paratext or Bibledit, and the scripture data essentially stays within
the Paratext or Bibledit projects. Adapt It automatically makes
copies of the data and creates its own project for the purposes of
adaptation, and Adapt It automatically transfers its target texts
(translation drafts) back to Paratext or Bibledit. Hence, all data is
destined to start and end within the designated Paratext/Bibledit
projects.</p>
<p>The above &quot;intelligent&quot; file browser can be helpful if
you do not plan to work with Adapt It in collaboration with Paratext
or Bibledit. In such cases, you can use this dialog to copy potential
source texts into an Adapt It project's __SOURCE_INPUTS folder.</p>

<h2 class="western"><a name="Special_Balsa_considerations"></a>Special
considerations for using Adapt It under the Balsa system</h2>
<p>What version of Balsa are you using? If you are using Balsa based
on any distribution after Lucid, you should already have Adapt It
version 6.x.x. In that case you should check to see if there are any
recent updates to Adapt It version 6.x.x at the packages.sil.org
repository. When the Lucid version of Balsa boots up, and you log on
to the Balsa User account, the opening screen looks like this:</p>
<p align="center"> <img border="0" src="Images/Admin_help/BalsaOpeningScreen.gif" width="500" height="293" alt="Balsa opening screen" >
</p>
<p>The Lucid version of Balsa as shown above has Adapt It version
5.2.4. You will need Adapt It version 6.x.x in order to take
advantage of its new features designed for assisting translation
program administrators, and especially working in collaboration with
the Balsa Scripture editor Bibledit. The icon for Adapt It version 6
looks like this:</p>
<p align="center"> <img border="0" src="Images/Admin_help/ai_new_icon.gif" width="107" height="118" alt="Adapt It logo" >
</p>
<p align="center" 
<strong><font align="center" face="Arial">Adapt It</font></strong> 
</p>
<p>When the Balsa system boots up it shows two accounts: <strong>Advisor</strong>
and <strong>Balsa User</strong>. <strong>You as an administrator need
to log in first as Advisor</strong> to update Adapt It to its latest
version 6 update which has many new features designed to assist you
as an administrator. Then, once you have upgraded Adapt It to version
6, you should <strong>log off as Advisor</strong> and <strong>log
back in as the</strong> <strong>Balsa User</strong> to complete the
setup of Adapt It for that given user. Except for upgrading Adapt It
to the latest version 6.x.x, all remaining setup of Adapt It should
be done using the Balsa User account.</p>
<p><strong>Note: any data you create while logged into the Advisor
account in Balsa does NOT appear within Adapt It when Balsa is
logged into the Balsa User account, and likewise any data the
user creates within Adapt It under the Balsa User account does
not appear when logged into the Advisor account.</strong></p>
<p>The steps for doing these things are listed below:</p>
<h3 class="western">Logging on to the Advisor account and upgrading
Adapt It to version 6 (if needed)</h3>
<p>1. Log onto the <strong>Advisor</strong> account in the Balsa
system.<br/>
2. Run the <strong>Synaptic Package Manager</strong> by
selecting it from the Applications &gt; System menu. In the Quick
search box type the word adaptit. The &quot;Installed&quot; version
of adaptit listed there should be at least 6.2.1, but preferably
6.5.3 or newer. If the package manager doesn't indicate that the
recommended version is already installed, you should go ahead and
mark it for installation. If you are using an 8GB SD card form of
Balsa, you probably will want to also mark adaptit-docs for
installation (although please note that the adaptit-docs
package is about 11MB of download). <br/>
3. After you have
ensured that Adapt It version 6.2.x or newer is installed, you can
close the package manager and <strong>log off the Balsa Advisor
account</strong>. Next you will need to log on to the Balsa User
account (see below).</p>
<h3 class="western">Logging on to the Balsa User account and
configuring Adapt It for adaptation work on a project</h3>
<p>1. Log onto the <strong>Balsa User</strong> account.<br/>
2. On
the &quot;Work&quot; desktop double click on the <strong>Adapt It
icon</strong> to start up Adapt It.<br/>
3. Set up the necessary
Bibledit projects for collaboration. You need at least two Bibledit
projects: One for obtaining source texts, and one for receiving
translation (target text) drafts.<br/>
4. Access Adapt It's
<strong>Administrator menu</strong> (see how to access the
Administrator menu <a href="#Setting_up_an_administrator_password">here</a>).<br/>
5.
After creating the Bibledit projects (step 3), set up Adapt it to
collaborate with Bibledit (follow the <a href="#Bibledit_Steps_Start">Bibledit</a>
section of this document for detailed steps).<br/>
6. Assign
locations for inputs and outputs using the dialog for that purpose.
It is recommended that you tick all of the &quot;Protect from
Navigation&quot; check boxes. See <a href="#Pre_assign_locations_for_inputs_outputs">this
section</a> for details.</p>
<p align="left">If your user(s) will be using Balsa for one type of
collaboration project you might consider setting up dedicated
launcher(s).</p>
<p align="right"><a href="#Top_of_doc">Back to Top</a></p>
<h2 class="western"><a name="Setup_custom_work_folder"></a>Set up a
custom work folder (Optional)</h2>
<p>For most users you should just allow Adapt It to create and
maintain its default &quot;Adapt It Unicode Work&quot; folder (or
&quot;Adapt It Work&quot; for the non-Unicode version) in the default
location. For Windows systems, Adapt It will by default create this
folder in the user's &quot;Documents&quot; (or &quot;My Documents&quot;)
folder. For Linux systems this work folder will be created in the
/home/&lt;user&gt; folder. On Mac systems this folder will be created
in the /Users/&lt;user&gt; folder.</p>
<p>In some cases you may want Adapt It to use a custom work folder in
a non-default location -- such as on a different disk partition, or
in a different folder than the default location. You can use the
Administrator menu's &quot;Custom Work Folder...&quot; item to assign
the location where Adapt It will establish its work folder. When you
select &quot;Custom Work Folder&quot;, Adapt It displays a
standard dialog in which you can navigate to the location where you
want Adapt It to establish its work folder.</p>
<p>Adapt It will remember any custom work folder location
that you specify -- until such time as you, the administrator
specify a different location or choose &quot;Restore Default Work
Folder Location&quot; from the Administrator menu. If you establish a
custom work folder location Adapt It will offer to lock it in that
location. If you choose not to lock it in that location, Adapt It
will only continue using that location for the current work session.</p>
<p>You need to be aware that if you create a custom work folder and
then change back to the default work folder, none of the work done in
the custom folder transfers to the default folder. The same is true
in the other direction. You as the administrator are responsible to
make those file transfers if they are needed. For this reason, the
Adapt It team recommends that custom work folders are used rarely and
if you choose to do so, you use them consistently instead of the
default folders.</p>

<h3 class="western">Preparations for Collaboration Work (with
Paratext or Bibledit)</h3>
<p>* <strong>Prepare the Paratext/Bibledit projects.</strong> You as
Administrator should prepare the Paratext/Bibledit projects <strong>BEFORE</strong>
setting up Adapt It collaboration. You should make sure that <a href="#Paratext_Steps_Start">Paratext</a>
or <a href="#Bibledit_Steps_Start">Bibledit</a> has <strong>at least
TWO projects</strong> :</p>
<p>1. A project that contains the source language texts from which
Adapt It will obtain its source texts for adaptation work. Preferably
this Paratext/Bibledit project should contain all the available
source texts that will be used in collaboration. 
</p>
<p>2. You also should make sure that Paratext or Bibledit has a
<strong>different</strong> project created which will receive the
adapted translation drafts produced by Adapt It. 
</p>
<p>If your user will be preparing free translations, you should also
create a third project in Paratext/Bibledit to receive free
translations. The books you create in the Paratext/Bibledit projects
for receiving the target text and free translations can be empty
but they should be created with (empty) chapter and verse
numbers. Ensure that the (empty) books created correspond to the
books that exist in the source language project.</p>
<p>* <strong>Setup Paratext/Bibledit Collaboration.</strong> You as
Administrator should setup collaboration using the &quot;Setup or
Remove Collaboration...&quot; menu item on the Adapt It Administrator
menu. Using that Adapt It dialog, designate the
Paratext/Bibledit projects that are to be used for a given Adapt It
project. You can set configure different collaboration settings for
different Adapt It projects. This ensures that the user will not have
to do any setup, but can simply start working by selecting the Adapt
It project to enter, choosing whether to turn collaboration on or
off, and if collaboration is on, choosing the book and chapter to
work on. After configuring Adapt It projects for collaboration, you
should ensure that things are working correctly by doing what the
user would do: select an Adapt It project from the opening page of
the Start Working wizard, choosing to turn collaboration on (or off)
for that project, and if collaboration is turned on, selecting a
scripture book and a chapter from the &quot;Get Source Text from
Paratext/Bibledit Project dialog&quot;. If you get any errors, see
the <a href="#trouble_shooting_collaboration">Trouble Shooting</a>
topic.</p>
<p>* <strong>Setup a user workflow profile.</strong> You as
Administrator should carefully consider the skill and experience
of the user, and determine if one of Adapt It's pre-configured
<a href="#Setup_User_Workflow_Profile">user workflow profiles</a>
would be appropriate for a given user. You can
establish a user profile using the Administrator menu's &quot;User
Workflow Profiles...&quot; menu item. The <strong>Novice</strong>
user profile hides most menu items and options that are not
absolutely necessary for basic adaptation work. The <strong>Experienced</strong>
and <strong>Skilled</strong> profiles enable more menu items and
interface options. You can also customize any of the profiles or
design your own profile using the <strong>Custom</strong> user
profile. If you decide to use a profile, you should practice using
Adapt It yourself with that profile in force, or at least closely
watch the user working with that user profile in effect, to make sure
that the options that remain visible are suitable for the skills
and the work expected of that user. You don't want to hide options
that a user really will need to do his job.</p>
<p>* <strong>Assign Locations for Inputs and Outputs.</strong> During
collaboration with Paratext or Bibledit, Adapt It automatically
limits the locations for source text inputs and target text outputs
to the Paratext or Bibledit project being used in collaboration. But,
Adapt It is able to do other kinds of inputs and exports. You as
Administrator, should decide whether your user should be &quot;protected&quot;
from the possibility of getting inputs from the wrong place, and
exporting outputs to the wrong place. Without such protection files
can get lost or misplaced. We suggest that you select all of the
&quot;Protect from Navigation&quot; check boxes in the &quot;<a href="#Pre_assign_locations_for_inputs_outputs">Assign
Locations for Inputs and Outputs</a>&quot; dialog. When the &quot;Protect
from Navigation&quot; check box is ticked, Adapt It will
automatically name and locate files for that particular type of input
or output, placing the files within Adapt It's special folders.</p>
<p>* <strong>Check the settings in Adapt It's Preferences dialog.</strong>
The Preferences dialog is accessible from the <strong>Edit </strong>menu
with a document loaded for collaboration. You as Administrator should
ensure that Adapt It is using the correct <strong>Fonts</strong>,
<strong>Punctuation</strong>, and any <strong>Case equivalences</strong> for
the languages involved in the collaboration work. Use the tabs in the
Preferences dialog to make any needed changes.</p>
<h3 class="western">Training points for Collaboration Work (with
Paratext or Bibledit)</h3>
<p>Once you have done the necessary preparations as described in the
&quot;Preparations for Collaboration Work&quot; section above, you
should provide some supervised training in the use of Adapt It. Your
training should include the following:</p>
<p>* <strong>Supervised &quot;hands-on&quot; adaptation work
with the actual texts of the collaboration project.</strong> There is
a document supplied with Adapt It installations called &quot;Adapt It
Tutorial.doc&quot;. Chapter 1 of that Tutorial contains information
that is focused on situations where Adapt It is set up to work
with texts apart from collaboration scenarios. It covers information
that you as administrator might find helpful, but the user will not
need to understand to work in collaboration with Paratext or
Bibledit. However, chapter 2 of the Adapt It Tutorial.doc is
called &quot;Working on a document&quot;, and contains good
information and exercises. You will want to adapt the information
and procedures demonstrated there to your actual collaboration
texts. Hence, you should help the user practice using actual texts in
the collaboration project until s/he feels comfortable working
with Adapt It. The knowledge and adaptation skills that treated in
the tutorial and that are important for the user to develop are:</p>
<p>1. Understanding the parts of Adapt It's main window (menus,
toolbar, modebar, layout of strips, piles).<br/>
2. Positioning the
phrase box, typing text into it, pressing Enter to advance it.<br/>
3.
Merging source words to make a source phrase.<br/>
4. Unmerging a
source phrase.<br/>
5. Accepting a default adaptation without
changes.<br/>
6. Retranslating a section of source text; removing or
editing a retranslation.<br/>
7. Inserting an extra word or phrase;
removing inserted words or phrases.<br/>
8. Reading your translation
without the source text being shown.<br/>
9. Single-step mode versus
Automatic mode.<br/>
10. When there are multiple translations - the
Choose Translation dialog.<br/>
11. Leaving a source word
untranslated - three kinds of &quot;nothing&quot;.</p>
<p>There is also a more comprehensive &quot;Adapt It Reference.doc&quot;
document which you may find helpful.</p>
<p>* <strong>Getting texts by &quot;Chapter Only&quot;</strong> is
the default method of exchanging texts with Paratext or Bibledit. You
as administrator can select to &quot;Get Chapter Only&quot; or &quot;Get
Whole Book&quot; within your &quot;Setup or Remove Collaboration&quot;
dialog accessible from the Administrator menu. However, we recommend
that you leave the default set as &quot;Get Chapter Only&quot;.
Single chapter chunks load and save more quickly than whole books
such as the Gospels and Acts. Since Adapt It organizes everything and
automatically does all transfers between Adapt It and Paratext or
Bibledit, there is no logistical problem for the user to work
chapter by chapter. Even when working chapter by chapter, Adapt It
automatically transfers the chapter's translation work back into the
whole books when Adapt It saves the translation work. In any case,
you should not change between collaborating by Chapter Only and Whole
Book for a given book. If adapting chapter-by-chapter, the user
should continue working chapter-by-chapter until the whole book is
finished.</p>
<p>* <strong>Reporting Problems and Giving Feedback</strong>. Adapt
It is provided free of charge under an open source license. The
developers are quick to respond to email reports of problems and
requests. They depend on the reports of any problems as well as
feedback from field users to improve Adapt It. Before reporting
problems to the developers, please have a look at the <a href="#trouble_shooting_collaboration">Trouble
Shooting</a> topic below. If that does not help you resolve the
problem, feel free to contact the developers either via email or via
the &quot;Report a Problem...&quot; selection in Adapt It's help menu
(see below).</p>
<p>Adapt It version 6 now has an easy to use email reporting feature
- located on the Adapt It Help menu. Just click on the Help menu item
labeled &quot;<strong>Report a Problem...</strong>&quot; and Adapt It
will display the following dialog - with much of the information
already filled in:</p>
<p align="center"> <img border="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Report_a_problemDlg.gif" width="400" height="396" alt="Report a problem" >
</p>
<p>Just fill in your email address, the email subject/summary, your
name and a brief description of the steps to reproduce the problem,
using the text in the edit box as a guide for your comments. If a
document is open that illustrates the problem, just click on the
&quot;Attach the document (packed)&quot; button to include a copy of
the packed document along with the report. If you have access to the
Internet, you can click on the &quot;Send Now&quot; button to send
your report. Adapt It also saves a copy of your report in the
_LOGS_EMAIL_REPORTS folder located in its &quot;Adapt It (Unicode)
Work&quot; folder. The usage log is automatically included in the
email report (unless you untick the check box). It would likely
provide information and possible error messages that would help us
understand the cause of any problem. When the "Send this to my email
program (I'll send it from there)" button is selected, Adapt It sends
the report directly to the user's default email program where the
user can edit the report further (if needed), and send it to the 
Adapt It developers from the user's email program.</p>
<p>There is also a Help menu item called &quot;<strong>Give
Feedback...</strong>&quot;. The form looks similar to the form for
reporting a problem, but is provided to make giving feedback easier
to do via email:</p>
<p align="center"> <img border="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Give_Feedback.gif" width="400" height="396" alt="Give Feedback" >
</p>
<p>Just fill in your email address, the email subject/summary, your
name and your feedback in the edit box provided. Use the text in the
box as a guide.</p>
<p>Note: Adapt It sends all such emails to the developers using
secured SSL encryption directly from the Adapt It program, so email
communications are done safely. The user's computer does not have to
have an email client installed to send these reports.</p>

<h2 class="western"><a name="setting_up_desktop_launchers"></a>Setting
Up Adapt It Desktop Launchers For Specific Work Scenarios (using
command-line switches/options)</h2>
<p>This section describes how to set up desktop icons or &quot;launchers&quot;
to make it easy for users to start up Adapt It for a given work
session. It also describes how you can configure a launcher with a
command-line switch/option that forces Adapt It to run with in a
certain mode for the work session. First, we provide a description of
the command-line options and how they work. Afterwards we provide
information on how to setup desktop launchers for typical Windows and
Linux (including Balsa) systems.</p>
<h3 class="western"><a name="command_line_switches"></a>The
command-line switches:</h3>
<p><b>-xo</b>   the <b>-xo</b> switch can be used to force
Adapt It to accommodate the unusual screen density (DPI), font and
bitmap handling of the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) XO computer. This
switch forces Adapt It to use double-sized bitmap images in its tool
bar, and a double line of controls on its mode bar. This arrangement
helps to make the tool bar buttons more accessible and the mode bar
items more likely to fit within the screen on an XO computer.</p>
<p><b>-wf</b>   the <b>-wf</b> switch/option can be used to
force Adapt It to always use a specified folder path for its work
folder. The -wf switch must be followed by the absolute folder path
to be used for Adapt It's work folder. Ordinarily Adapt It's work
folder would be located at:<br/>
  
<b>C:\Users\&lt;userName&gt;\Documents\Adapt It Unicode Work\</b>  
on recent versions of Windows systems (Windows Vista, Windows 7 and
Windows 8) <br/>
   <b>/home/&lt;userName&gt;/Adapt It
Unicode Work/ </b>  on most distributions of Linux systems<br/>
  
<b>/Users/&lt;userName&gt;/Adapt It Unicode Work/ </b>  on
Macintosh OS X systems<br/>
The -wf switch could be used to force
Adapt It to place its project folders in a non-standard location such
as in a /data/ folder of an external thumb drive. For example, on
Windows the work folder location might be at:<br/>
  
<b>E:\data\</b><br/>
and the command-line Target for this in a
launcher would be:<br/>
   <b>&quot;C:\Program Files\Adapt
It WX Unicode\Adapt_It_Unicode.exe&quot; -wf E:\data\<br/>
Note:
Command-line switches/options that include paths or file names
containing spaces must be enclosed in double quote marks.</b></p>
<p><strong>-frm</strong>    the <b>-frm</b> switch can
be used to force Adapt It to operate only in reviewing mode. This
switch should only be used in special circumstances in which you want
the user to produce a very literal gloss or adaptation for the source
text. In Reviewing mode Adapt It does not supply adaptations
automatically nor jump to the next available hole in the translation.
In this mode Adapt It's knowledge base still stores the meanings that
are being typed in by the user. But it does not automatically do any
lookups or offer any translation equivalents as the user works. This
mode therefore forces the user to type in a gloss or adaptation for
every source text word or phrase. This switch/mode is being used in
places where the administrator feels that a translator does not yet
have enough training to be able to interpret potential translational
renderings that Adapt It might enter automatically from its knowledge
base.</p>
<p>[Other command-line switches may be added in a future version of
Adapt It]</p>
<h3 class="western">Setting up desktop launchers in Windows</h3>
<p>1. <strong>Install Adapt It version 6.2.1 or newer</strong>.<br/>
2.
Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the Adapt It installation
folder, and click on the Adapt It program executable file, normally
located at <strong>c:\Program Files\Adapt It WX
Unicode\Adapt_It_Unicode.exe</strong> for the Unicode version, or
<strong>c:\Program Files\Adapt It WX\Adapt_It.exe</strong> for the
Regular (ANSI) version. (On a 64bit Windows machine, the installation
folder is within the <strong>Program Files (x86)</strong> folder.)<br/>
3.
Right-click on the Adapt_It_Unicode.exe (or Adapt_It.exe) file and
select &quot;<strong>Send To</strong>&quot; &gt; &quot;<strong>Desktop
(create shortcut)</strong>&quot;.<br/>
4. Close or minimize Windows
Explorer and any other programs so you can see the shortcut that was
created in the previous step. <strong>Right-click</strong> on that
shortcut and select &quot;<strong>Rename</strong>&quot;. Then enter a
brief name for this launcher, possibly something like &quot;Peter's
Adapt It work&quot;. The launcher name should be short but worded
so that the user(s) can distinguish this launcher from any others you
plan to create for other work scenarios.<br/>
5. <strong>Right-click</strong>
on the desktop shortcut and select &quot;<strong>Properties</strong>
&quot;. You should see a Shortcut properties dialog that looks
something like this:</p>
<p align="center"> <img border="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Windows_shortcut_properties.gif" width="300" height="424" alt="Windows shortcut properties" >
</p>
<p>6. If a command-line switch is desired for this launcher, it would
be added at the end of the existing text that is in the &quot;<strong>Target</strong>&quot;
edit box (with an intervening space). Press the right arrow key or
click in the box to remove the highlight, but keep the existing text
there in the edit box. If you want to add a command-line switch, add
a space at the end of the existing text path <strong>after the last
quote mark</strong>, and then <strong>type the command-line option,
for example</strong>:<br/>
     <strong><font face="Courier">-wf
e:\data<br/>
</font></strong><font face="Times New Roman">7. Click on
OK to save and close the Shortcut Properties dialog. Your desktop
launcher is now ready to use. <br/>
8. Double-click the newly
created desktop shortcut icon labeled &quot;Peter's Adapt
It work&quot; to launch Adapt It. Adapt It will start running and if
a command-line switch was used it will be forced to run in the
desired mode.<br/>
9. To create other launchers for different Adapt
It work scenarios, follow steps 2 through 8 above, adjusting the name
of the desktop launcher in step 4, and any command-line switch/option
used in step 6 according to the work scenario you want the launcher
to run.</font> 
</p>
<h3 class="western">Setting up desktop launchers in Linux (Ubuntu)</h3>

the search bar at the top. When the Adapt It icon appears click on it
and drag it to an empty area of your desktop.<br/>
4. Close or
minimize any other programs so you can see the desktop shortcut that
was created in the previous step. <strong>Right-click</strong> on
that shortcut and select &quot;<strong>Rename...</strong>&quot;. Then
enter a brief name for this launcher, possibly something like
&quot;Peter's Adapt It work&quot;. The launcher name should be
short but worded so that the user(s) can distinguish this launcher
from any others you plan to create for other work scenarios.<br/>
5.
<strong>Right-click</strong> on the desktop shortcut and select
&quot;<strong>Properties</strong> &quot;. You should see an Adapt It
Properties dialog that looks something like this:</p>
<p align="center"> <img border="0" src="Images/Admin_help/Linux_shortcut_properties.gif" width="500" height="435" alt="Linux shortcut properties" >
</p>
6. If a command-line switch is desired for this launcher, it would
be added to the end of the existing text that is in the &quot;<strong>Command</strong>&quot;
edit box (with an intervening space). Press the right arrow key or
click in the box to remove the highlight, but keep the existing text
there in the edit box. If you want to add a command-line switch, add
a space at the end of the existing text path <strong>after the last

</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>
3. In the &quot;Name:&quot; edit box, enter a
brief name for this launcher, possibly something like &quot;Peter's
Adapt It work&quot;. The launcher name should be short but worded so
that the user(s) can distinguish this launcher from any others you
plan to create for other work scenarios.<br/>
4. The &quot;Command:&quot;
edit box is where you construct the command-line to launch
Adapt It along any desired command-line switch/option. Click on the
folder icon at the right end of the &quot;Command:&quot; edit box. A
&quot;Select an Application&quot; dialog comes up that lists the
available applications. Scroll down a little to the <strong>adaptit</strong>

<h3 class="western">Problems in Collaboration with Paratext</h3>
<p>Note: Many fixes have been made to the Paratext/Bibledit
collaboration feature in recent versions of Adapt It. Hence, you
should make sure that you are using the newest version of Adapt It
that is available from the adapt-it.org website. You can check 
the version of Adapt It by selecting &quot;About
Adapt It...&quot; from Adapt It's Help menu.</p>
<p><strong>Important: We have found that collaboration problems
sometimes result from wrong project sharing roles assigned for the
Paratext Target text project that Adapt It is trying to use for a
collaboration project involving Adapt It and Paratext. It is
important that the Paratext Target text project that you create to
receive Adapt It's adaptation text, be assigned the &quot;Translator&quot;
(or &quot;Administrator&quot;) role on the user's computer that is
doing the collaboration work between Adapt It and Paratext. If the
Target text project in Paratext on the user's computer is not given
the Translator or Administrator role, Adapt It will not be able to
automatically save the Target text that is being created during the
adaptation process over to the Paratext file storage location.</strong>
</p>
<p>Adapt It relies on a separate utility program that it uses to
exchange data between Adapt It and Paratext. Paratext installs a
utility program called <strong>rdwrtp7.exe</strong> or <strong>rdwrtp8.exe</strong>
that Adapt It attempts to execute when collaborating with Paratext.
The newest version of Paratext 9 also continues to install the utility
program named <strong>rdwrtp8.exe even though Paratext 9 is being used.
Ordinarily you need not worry about
these utility programs. However, we have not been able to test these
utility programs on all possible computer system configurations and
architectures. So, if you get errors when attempting to setup
collaboration between Adapt It and Paratext, it is likely that the
problem could be a compatibility problem that we have not yet had to
account for between your computer system and the version of the
utility program installed by Adapt It. (There is an as yet unverified
possibility that Kaspersky (or possibly another antivirus) program 
prevents the successful transfer
of adaptations to Paratext. Try &quot;killing&quot; the running
Kaspersky process in your current work session and then check if
collaboration then works correctly.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>When you have upgraded to the newer version 8, you should
make sure that all Paratext projects get migrated from the old
Paratext 7 installation over to the new Paratext 8 installation. You
also must upgrade your version of Adapt It to at least version 6.8.2.
Older versions of Adapt It (especially those before version 6.8.0)
will NOT collaborate with version 8 of Paratext. After you (as
administrator) have upgraded a user's Paratext from version 7 to
version 8, you should also upgrade the user's Adapt It version to 
the more recent version available at adapt-it.org. Then you should 
also ensure that Adapt It can
still collaborate with the newer version of Paratext. If you
encounter a problem with Adapt It - Paratext collaboration after
updating your Paratext installation, please let us know so we can
provide an Adapt It update that will correct the problem. Such
problems are not very likely to happen between Adapt It and Paratext,
but if they do happen it is most likely they would happen after a
fairly major update of either Paratext or Adapt It. Please write down
the text of any error messages that appear, and include those with
any problem reports you send us. If you have Internet access and use
email you can
try submitting a report using the &quot;Report
a Problem...&quot; selection from Adapt It's Help menu, or send us a
report via regular email - our email addresses are shown on Adapt
It's &quot;About Adapt It...&quot; selection on the Help menu.</strong></p>
<h3 class="western"><strong>Problems in Collaboration with Bibledit</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Note: Most problems in collaboration between Adapt It and
Bibledit can be solved by ensuring that your version of Adapt It is
at least version 6.6.4 and your version of Bibledit is at least 4.3.
See the <a href="#Bibledit_Steps_Start">Step 1 of the Bibledit setup
process</a>. If you have done all the setup steps for Bibledit, but
are still having problems, the information below may be of some help.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adapt It relies on a separate utility program that it uses
to exchange data between Adapt It and Bibledit. There are different
utility programs for different computer architectures (32-bit,
64-bit, etc.) and Ubuntu distributions. Bibledit version 4.3 and
newer installs an executable file called bibledit-rdwrt for
collaboration with Bibledit on Linux systems. Ordinarily you need not
worry about this utility program. However, we have not been able to
test these utility programs on all possible computer system
configurations, and especially on different Linux
distributions/architectures. So, if you get errors when attempting to
setup collaboration between Adapt It and Bibledit, it is likely that
the problem could be a compatibility problem that we have not yet had
to account for between your computer system and the version of the
utility program installed by Adapt It. If you still find that
collaboration with Bibledit is failing, please inform the Adapt
It developers about the problem, so we can find a solution and
possibly make a corrected version available in a future update.
Please write down the text of any error messages that appear, and
include that information with any problem reports you send us.
If you have Internet access you can try submitting a report directly
from Adapt It (see the &quot;Report a Problem...&quot; selection from
Adapt It's Help menu), or send us a report via regular email - our
email addresses are shown on Adapt It's &quot;About Adapt It...&quot;
selection on the Help menu. Please include what distribution of
Ubuntu you are running and whether it is a 32-bit (i386) or
64-bit (amd64) system, plus any other details you think might help us
to provide a fix. Detailed information about your system should
be available by accessing your System Info (via System
