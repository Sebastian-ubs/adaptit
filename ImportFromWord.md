# Introduction #

If your source text file has been prepared in Microsoft word, and you do not save the file as a text file (txt), the result in Adapt It will appear as garbage symbols.

Adapt It cannot use the standard Word formats such as doc or rtf as input.

# Procedure #

  1. Open the Word Document that you want to import.
  1. From the File Menu select Save As….
  1. Type the desired file name into the text box at the bottom.
  1. Type in the file name you want to use.
  1. Select the file type of txt from the combo box labeled “Save as type:.” Click on the down arrow to display the list of options, scroll down and select the item "Plain Text (.txt)"
  1. Click Save.
  1. You should see a dialog called "File Conversion - <your document's name>"
    * If you are using Western fonts, continue to the next step.
    * If you are using non-Western fonts, click the "Other encoding" button. The list at the top right becomes enabled.
    * Scroll until you see an entry called "Unicode" (There are several entries that include the word Unicode; choose the one that just says Unicode.)
