## _Adapt It_ ##
| ![http://adapt-it.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/AIWX.png](http://adapt-it.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/AIWX.png) | _**Adapt It**_ is an application that translates or adapts source text documents into target or translated text. This process depends on the knowledge of the human translator in understanding both languages. <p> <i><b>Adapt It</b></i> maintains a Knowledge Base which stores word and phrase adaptations that can be automatically inserted into the target text, thus speeding the translation process. <p> <i><b>Adapt It</b></i> uses plain text (txt) files for input and expects the use of Unified Standard Format Markers (USFM) in the input file. The translated text can be exported as a USFM text file or a Rich Text format file. </tbody></table>
