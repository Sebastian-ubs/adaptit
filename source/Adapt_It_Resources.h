/// \description	This is the header file for Adapt It's resources and resource functions 
/// used by Adapt It. These resources were created initially by wxDesigner. The wxDesigner
/// generated C++ code in Adapt_It_wdr.h was copied to this header file, and
/// The wxDesigner generated C++ code in Adapt_It_wdr.h is #include into this header file. 
/// The Adapt_It_wdr.h and Adapt_It_wdr.cpp files are still incorporated into the Adapt It project
/// but require the running of the sedConvert.sh script to make them compatible with the wxWidgets
/// 3.1.x library (the script updates depricated font symbols and removes some wxALIGN... flags
/// to prevent run-time asserts from the 3.1.x library from pestering the user. 
/// With the advent of wxWidgets version 3.1.x and later, the old wxDesigner generated code was
/// producing code that would cause run-time asserts mostly due to improper combinations of wxSizer
/// wxALIGNMENT... style flags. Also wxDesigner's generated code was also increasingly resulting in 
/// deprecated code warnings, such as those related to its use of its outdated wxFont constants, 
/// where it was using wxSWISS, wxNORMAL, wxBOLD, instead of the newer constants wxFONTFAMILY_SWISS, 
/// wxFONTSTYLE_NORMAL, wxFONTWEIGHT_BOLD.
///
/// [see Adapt_It_Resources.cpp for list of functions that require manual modifications]
